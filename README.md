---3Ddiff_Simulation Readme---

Python script to simulate 3D random diffusion along a sphere. The number of steps can be specified and the stepsize of the diffusion can be specified in degrees. 

The data can be visualized with a simple plot of the diffusion along the sphere, where time can be optionally drawn as the radius of the trajectory along the sphere. 

The diffusion coordinates can be saved as an hdf5 file in the specified directory through the filedialog option. 

Required Python packages: 
numpy
h5py
tkinter
matplotlib
